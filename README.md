# React Coding Challenge

This code challenge is designed to test your skills in coding, problem solving, designing modular code and writing unit tests. It also aims at assessing your knowledge of React.

You are asked to develop a web application. The purpose of the application is to visualise an Electrocardiogram (ECG) in a graphical interface. The ECG to display is contained in a file in the data directory.

The challenge participant should read the file, which contains a long ECG recording, and show the signal in a user friendly way. In addition, the user shall be able to navigate across the signal, going backward and fordward, zoom in and out, with the ability to select the area to zoom in. 

Here is an example image of the expected result

For the implementation, we ask the following:

- Add a header to the web page which says "Idoven.ai Coding Challenge"

- Use Material UI https://mui.com/

- Use React function components

- Use React context API and hooks to showcase your understanding of these React features

- Write meaninful and useful unit tests. You can use jest.

- Provide clean code and structure. Your implementation should be more like how you do it for any production grade application development

- (bonus) Define Typescript where necessary

- Pay attention to performance of your page rendering

Please take the time you need to complete the challenge to the best of your ability within the allowed 7 days. Please submit your code either via Github or Gitlab
